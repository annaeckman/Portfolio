//Ideas:
projects with demos and live deployments from github
include:
python rock paper scissors!
build this out into a site
about me page
get this from other laptop
coffee shop site
around the us site
build a small thing out with the desmos code provided on their website?

music I like to code to with an array that it's randomly pulling from?
